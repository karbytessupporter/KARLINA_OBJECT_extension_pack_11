<p>Some people (i.e. X) insist on being beaten up by people other than themselves (i.e. by Y where Y is not X and where Y is intentionally violent or otherwise &#8220;aggressive&#8221; towards X) so that they have some drama and victim status to be entertained by and socially rewarded for. I would rather avoid being anywhere near those people (i.e. X) than be near them because I do not want to have to be coerced by X into being part of X or else into being Y. </p>
<p>X demands that I not ridicule them nor speak of them disparagingly and that I be physically coerced into being either X or else Y. X wants me to be stupider, meaner, and uglier than I prefer to be (and I do mean to imply that X and Y are stupider, meaner, and uglier than I am and want to be). X demands to be treated like the world&#8217;s most precious cargo and as innocent as prepubescent kids while not condescended to as such. Such people have even told me to my face that they would steal my physical property as punishment for acting pretentious. Such people seem to get a lot of community support and permission to act tyrannical and antagonistic towards me (perhaps because such people exemplify conservative Christian family values over intellectual freedom and individual autonomy). </p>
<p>Rather than try to strategize how to prevent X from sabotaging my personal goals further than they already have (because avoiding X seems futile due to the fact that X seems to infiltrate (and lower the quality of) many locations I frequent (and I think it is unjust to forbid such people from frequenting such places)), I would rather treat most humans I encounter as potentially X until I gather sufficient empirical evidence which convinces me that any such person is not X. (If I think someone is using what I think is excessive coercion to get my attention or to influence my thoughts, I will most likely dismiss that person as X). I therefore am currently pretending X is the ruling class despite being so mentally and physically ill while people like me are amongst the few humans who are committed to facilitating their own and their entire species&#8217; technological advancement (instead of merely creating more needy people to attend to). I do my best to not get slowed down nor beaten up by X even as they try desperately to corner me into fighting with the bored lazy apes they are. I have been commenting to myself that humanity seems to be splitting into two species: the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transhuman</a> &#8220;cyborgs&#8221; who are more future-focused than past-focused and the &#8220;old world apes&#8221; who just want to partake in the quaint old tradition of getting married, having kids, and fortifying one&#8217;s household while not allowing oneself or anyone near them to think about existence beyond the next three generations of humans. The &#8220;old world apes&#8221; seem to believe that humanity will go extinct within two hundred years yet want to procure their own offspring for the domestic tranquility it will bring them exclusively and for less than one hundred years. What comes after those one hundred years is apparently an apocalypse for the human species according to those &#8220;old world apes&#8221;. Hence, they seem to do little other than dogmatically enforce that everyone around them act nonchalant and content to merely pursue cheap (easy to obtain) and unhealthy (anti longevity) hedonistic pleasure until one dies of &#8220;natural causes&#8221; (but really from delayed access to modern medicine including stem cell replacement body part procedures). </p>
