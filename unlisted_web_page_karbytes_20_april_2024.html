<p>If I seriously decide to believe that my future will neither exceed nor attain my bare minimum satisfaction requirements (according to me as an experiencer of that entire linear continuum referred to in this note as my future), then I give myself permission to end my life by my own voluntary efforts either with or without physician assistance (and never intentionally in a manner which injures a person other than myself, kills a person other than myself, or otherwise causes what is deemed by the experiencer to be intolerable suffering to any person).</p>
<p>I presently do not intend to voluntarily end my life within the next thirty years and I also admittedly intend to extend my life span and continuum of experiences (which I experience as consistently tolerable to me as those experiences&#8217; experiencer).</p>
<p>I admit with dismay and dread that I believe that, as I age towards a specific point in humanity&#8217;s timeline which is chronologically prior to what I consider to be adequately utopian conditions, the likelihood that I will feel suicidal (based on the conditional logic stated earlier in this note) will gradually if not exponentially increase especially in correlation to human population density increase and worsening environmental toxicity and climate destabilization conditions for humans (and for other sentient information processing agents). </p>
<p><strike>Rather than kill (or otherwise constrain the &#8220;free will&#8221; of) persons other than myself in order to ensure that such people will not be in my future experience while impeding my future experience from unfolding in ways I can actually enthusiastically say with earnest conviction are tolerable for me to actually go through, I would rather swiftly and with minimal explanation kill myself (and expect nothing I leave behind in terms of intellectual property or physical belongings (including body parts) be preserved) to avoid increasing any experiencer&#8217;s suffering.</strike></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Perhaps the most basic ethical rule I assigned myself to unconditionally heed is to always minimize how much suffering is generated per instance and for as many instances as possible.</span></p>
<p>If &#8220;sufficiently many&#8221; humans volunteer to be killed so that humans younger than them or otherwise other than them can more easily survive and thrive, then perhaps humans need not worry about imposing any restrictions on pregnancy and sexual (or asexual) reproduction because, by the time &#8220;generation beta&#8221; arrives and becomes adults, few people would want to jack up the population density back up to where it was during the most recent &#8220;dark ages&#8221; of human civilization. </p>
<p>Every human individual has a cost. How that cost is paid is largely a mystery but can probably already be precisely predicted (as a &#8220;ledger&#8221; of costs, payments, and transaction coordinates) by existing artificial intelligence. If every human individual&#8217;s total life expectancy costs (or at least for some arbitrarily finite period such as seventy years) is able to be determined with that precise of accuracy, then it can be determined relatively instantly whether or not human civilization can afford a new member just yet. </p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">What is left now but trying not to force anyone to renounce too much of their satisfaction in life?</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Edit: I am okay with hurting people other than myself if I think that hurting people other than myself is best way to prevent myself from undergoing what I consider to be intolerable experiences.</span></p>
