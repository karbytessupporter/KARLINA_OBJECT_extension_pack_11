<p><span style="font-family:monospace">To Whom It May Concern:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">There are some journal entries in the file directory named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_11</a> which are no longer representative of karbytes&#8217; beliefs and sentiments. Such journal entries (along with many other text files throughout the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) were hastily written by karbytes as a means to address the &#8220;concerns&#8221; which intrusive &#8220;thought police&#8221; coerced karbytes (through message spamming and other &#8220;legal&#8221; means of inflicting pain) into making more prominent on karbytes&#8217; blogging platform than what karbytes initially thought was appropriate in terms of karbytes&#8217; content goals. (karbytes prefers to take on a perspective which is increasingly non-anthropocentric and increasingly informed and experienced about physics, computation, mathematics, logic, and psychonautics while maintaining and writing from what appears to karbytes to be the same continuity of consciousness which karbytes observed reality through since the aforementioned website was established in the year 2022 (and a continuity of consciousness which undergoes an evolutionary transformation from being merely human to being &#8220;humanoid cyborg&#8221; by incrementally adding new technological &#8220;body parts&#8221; to karbytes and by repairing if not replacing damaged essential body parts)).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">The aforementioned &#8220;thought police&#8221; (which took the form of anonymous agents spamming my skull with electromagnetic signals which induced sounds heard by me and, to a lesser extent, which took the form of embodied humans placing themselves in sufficiently close physical proximity for me to inevitably see and hear them) seemed to want me to be preoccupied with exaggerated or biased pejorative race and gender stereotypes to the extent that I appear to the public to be a racist and/or sexist and/or ablist bigot and as someone to be dismissed as mentally ill (so that the content I have published which is more aligned with my content goals is more likely to be ignored by the public in favor of promoting more sensationalist entertainment such as trashy tabloids peppered with profanities).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:monospace">Within the past two days I thought deeply about the problems which seem to be subsets of militant anthropocentricism and came to the (logically sound) conclusion that humans are each too unique and complex to be regarded as interchangeable (on a physical level and on a societal utilitarian level). While stereotypes might emphasize traits which were observed to be common amongst people who were assigned that stereotype, a stereotype is a gross generalization about a rather large group of people based on a relatively small number of instances of people in that group exhibiting the behavioral traits which that stereotype encompasses. <span style="background:#00ff00">As human civilization&#8217;s knowledge infrastructure becomes increasingly sophisticated and robust, I expect stereotypes to not be very prominently emphasized because what I think will be almost universally practiced amongst humans is treating each person and each situation as unique and non-interchangeable entities which can be mined for potentially useful insights about broader domains.</span> What I mean to suggest is the following: as humanity (as a whole comprised of human(oid) individuals and as each of such individual) becomes increasingly intelligent and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agential</a>, the problems which humanity faces will also change. I believe that the potential for problems to arise always exists but the types of problems which arise depend on where the experiencers of that problem are in terms of those experiencers&#8217; technological prowess, personal fitness (mental and physical), and community rules (not to mention what exists simultaneously in such contexts beyond the scope of those experiencers&#8217; control).</span></p>
