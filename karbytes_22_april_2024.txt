According to my (current) knowledge, gender-affirming medical procedures such as hormones and genital surgery has become illegal for people who are less than 18 years old in the United States of America during the past two years (and abortion has also become illegal in many states (particularly where Republicans are more populous than Democrats) during that time period and in that country).

What I think is really going on is that politically conservative Republicans want to prevent male-to-female transsexuals from being able to convincingly present themselves to the general public as female because such transwomen would be undoubtedly sexually attractive to many heterosexual men and many of such men would be upset to learn that the girl they were pursuing and investing commitment resources in lacks the innate reproductive capacities of XX chromosomed humans. Forcing transgendered people to wait until they have already undergone puberty to start physically transitioning to their preferred gender ensures that transwomen will not look "too effiminate" to pass for cisgendered women.

Also what I think is going on is that conservative men are angry that women have been acting as sexually promiscuous as men due to women having access to birth control (yet even with the advent of affordable and generally effective birth control methods other than abortion, many women seem to undergo unwanted pregnancies which they demand to alleviate through abortion). While I do not sympathize with the sentiment that women should be less sexually outgoing and less encumbered by sex than men are, I do feel a bit of irritation towards the seemingly widespread culture of women being lackadaisical about using reliable birth control technologies such as intrauterine devices and hormones and then acting "surprised" and dismayed when their screwing around results in them becoming pregnant. I do not at all think banning abortion is good for anything but helping conservative men smirk at how men can run around having all the sex they want (including rape) and be assured that any pregnancies which arise from such promiscuity will neither be terminated nor be his financial nor social burden to be saddled with. What I mean to imply is that the push to make abortion widely illegal (a) punishes women who fail to properly "gird their loins" before they let any naked penises near them as punishment for "playing chicken" with their fertility as some sort of flippant or kinky game and (b) ensures that the human population growth rate will never fall to zero because vigilante rapists will do the job of ensuring some women, whether they want to or not, will be deprived of contraceptives and then be raped until they become pregnant through systematic raping.
