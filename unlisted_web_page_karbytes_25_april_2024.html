<p>Poor to middle class men (especially of Black or Brown ethnicity) are the token citizens. Such people are socialized to believe that life is tough, that people are cruel, and that aggression and violence are necessary tools for a man to get good things in life before his competitors do.</p>
<p>The women who act as the counterparts and support crew to such men are not nearly as violent but they are more depressed and more devoid of personal interests. Such women do little other than rudimentary upkeep of their own bodies and their children&#8217;s bodies by acquiring money through routinely performing some kind of menial labor service or by receiving &#8220;free&#8221; money from government, lenders, and donors (and almost always for the purpose of supporting minor children). Such women only socialize with women in their plight or with their children and only interact with men in sparse heterosexual male centric ways.</p>
<p>Those men are overtly angry a lot of the time while those women are much more passive aggressive and repressed in how they bottle up negative emotions without attempting to solve the problems which bother them. Such women are socialized to believe they are mostly powerless and invisible in society. Such men are socialized to believe they are at a lower caste than higher earning and more educated men but, nevertheless, such lower caste men are presented many recreational options and can pretty much spend most of their adult lives acting like teenagers or young adults who rule the ghettos and dominate the streets with their loud music, fast cars, and loaded guns. Many young women seem to have no other goal than to get some favorable attention from such guys and are hence unabashedly whorish and vapid (but that&#8217;s okay because having babies doesn&#8217;t take much work ethic nor educational credentials nor even money in such a system (which means that those girls spend a lot of time obsessing over cute pet animals and human children because that seems to advertise that she is content to do the bulk of the child care, elder care, and invalid care in her society while her male counterparts do things which are decidedly more macho, fun, and celebrated)).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying races other than Black and Hispanic are less barbaric. I think all humans are infant-centric and implicitly demand that anyone but themselves and their babies get killed or disenfranchised in place of themselves and their babies. I do not have biological offspring nor want any which means I am treated as less deserving of survival and thrival than those with kids are. I do think I deserve an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/proposed_principles_of_global_governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unconditional income</a> especially because I don&#8217;t insist on making babies as a means to ensure that society regards me as important and as deserving of survival and thrival. While I think all humans should be given an unconditional basic income sufficient to pay for all basic survival related (and some thrival related) expenses (while robots perform the bulk of civilization&#8217;s labor while keeping zero of the profits at whichever business they work), <span style="background:#00ff00">I think that the birth rate should drop significantly and perhaps even reach zero for the sake of allowing the 8 plus billion humans who are already alive the chance to each live for an indefinitely long time.</span> Until conditions are such that every human alive today is legally entitled to basic survival resources and the legal right to remain alive for an indefinitely long time (instead of forced to expire after a definite time period elapses), I would say no human is justified in making babies and that those who act otherwise are people I &#8220;secretly&#8221; want exterminated or at least prevented from making more babies.</p>
<p>When push comes to shove, I would almost certainly choose to save myself at the expense of any other human. Therefore, I doubt very many humans would regard me as a philanthropist nor as a good community member. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not interested in being part of some community comprised of humans. <span style="background:#00ff00">I prefer to limit my socializing and community membership to groups that center on common intellectual and recreational interests; not on common hardships or on genetic or physical closeness</span>. I tend to avoid and be shunned by groups which think a woman&#8217;s primary obligation is to bare and raise offspring (or to pursue a man who would facilitate her doing such with his support). Such groups act indignant that I am implicitly suggesting that most women are settling for being mere farm animals instead of intellectuals who have identities and goals which are independent of some factory farm of a community.</p>
