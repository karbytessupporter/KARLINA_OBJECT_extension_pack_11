I made some mistakes in karbytes_23_april_2024.txt:

mistake_0: insinuating that KARLINA and KARBYTES are not merely KARBYTES.

// The person named karbytes (according to the intellectual property which that person authored and which is also named karbytes) is not necessarily a subset of some other person's rendering of phenomena. 

mistake_1: insinuating that the consciousness of karbytes (which observes exclusively from the vantage of karbytes) will or has or already is existing outside of the lifespan of karbytes (and karbytes thus far has apparently existed for a finite amount of time (starting within the past 40 years) using a finite amount of energy).

// The consciousness of karbytes (or, perhaps more accurately, the mind which is karbytes) might possibly stop existing after a finite amount of time elapses following the time at which this note is published. Also, that particular mind might not have existed prior to that mind's particular "encompassing" hardware body coming into existence within the past 40 years of this note being published.
